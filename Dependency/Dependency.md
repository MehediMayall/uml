#### Dependency

In object oriented programming, a dependency is a relationship between two classes where one class relies on the functionalities of the other.

If changes in one of the class may cause changes to the other.

In OOP, dependencies appear in the form of instance creation inside a class. Through this instance, one class can access the methods of another class. This way classes become dependent.


In UML, dependency is represented as a dashed line that ends with open arrow head. The arrow points to the dependency.

A dependency is a directed relationship.
